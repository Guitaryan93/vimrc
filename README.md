# vimrc
Personal vimrc settings.

Adding any information here that might be useful in future. The goal of my vimrc is to keep things clean and simple, while leveraging the power of Vim and not relying on any plugins.
This should result in a universal set of Vim settings that I can use on any machine in any environment.
